WordPress ePub Export plugin

### What is it?

This is a WordPress plugin that allows you to export your blog posts as a monolithic eBook in ePub format. ePub is a cross platform standard used by all major eBook publishing platforms.

### But why?

WordPress is a fantastic framework for self-publishing. This plugin just makes it simple for you to organize your posts into something resembling a printed book in eBook format. Since ePub is a widely accepted standard, you can take the output of this plugin and submit it to Apple's iBook store, Amazon, The Gutenberg Project, Kobo, or simply let your readers download it to their iOS, Android, Kindle, or Windows Phone devices. I highly recommend finding a way to sell the file. Free content is nice, but people will pay for the convenience of having it with them whereever they go.

### How to use it:

Download the .zip and put it in your WordPress plugins directory. There's an admin panel and some widgets you can add to the post authoring panel. 

### Seems a little...incomplete.

It is. I've been sitting on this project for over a year. Needs a lot of work. Submit bug reports here. Feel free to fork it or just download it and make it better. It's based on the work of others (look inside to see creditation) and I lay no claim to any of the libraries I've pilfered to make this work. I did put a lot of my own effort into it, but that's the part that needs work and I simply don't have time for it right now.

### Contribute!

Let me know if you make improvements. I don't need credit, but it's fun to know someone else picked up from where I left off.
